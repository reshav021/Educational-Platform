democracies.\nThe Supreme Court has ruled in K.\nS.\nVandana Bharati V.\nState of Kerala case that not every constitutional amendment is permissible.\nThe amendment must respect the basic structure of the constitution which is immutable.\nIn 2000, the National Commission to review the working of the constitution was set up to look into updating the constitution.\nThank you.\n\n\nAnd once again, I wish to very happy republic day.\nJ.\nHymn.the constitution of india was adopted on 26th November 1949. it came into effect on 26th January 1950. the constitution is a federal in nature and also has a

    "audio_transcript": "India_ Climate, Vegetation and Wildlife\n\n Hello everyone, I am Kiran Joshi.\nHope you all are safe and sound.\nWelcome to class 6 Geography chapter 8 India Climate Vegetation and Wildlife.\nAs it is clear from the title of the chapter that we are going to learn about the climate of India its vegetation and wildlife in this chapter.\nLet's begin with the climate of India.\nBut before that let's understand the various terms used in this connection.\nYou may have heard and used the word weather quite often.\nChildren, weather is the daily state in the atmosphere.\nIt includes day to day changes in temperature, rainfall and sunshine etc.\nThe weather could be hotter, colder cold, cloudy or windy, sunny or wet.\nWhen certain fixed weather patterns continue over a few weeks or months, they are called seasons.\nIndia experiences four major seasons in a year that follow each other in a cycle.\nThen first one, the cold weather season or the winter season extends from December to February.\nThen the hot weather season or the summer season extends from March to May.\nThen the south western monsoon season or the rainy season or the advancing monsoon season extends from June to September.\nAnd the fourth season is the season of retreating monsoon or the autumn season extends from October and November.\nAs I said, the first season is the cold weather season or the winter season.\nIt falls between the months of December and February.\nDuring the winter season sun rays do not fall directly in the region.\nWinter is more severe in North India where the temperature drops very low.\n\n\nHowever, the south India especially the coastal areas hardly experience winter.\nAfter the winter season comes the summer season which extends from March to May.\nIn the season the sun rays fall, fall directly vertically in the region causing a sharp increase in temperature.\nStrong hot and dry winds called lu, blow during the day in the northern plains and northwestern parts of India.\nNext in the cycle is the southwest monsoon season that lasts from June to September.\nThe moisture-laden winds of southwest monsoon enter India from the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal.\nAs you can see from the map also, the onset of southwest monsoon occurs each year around the first week of June.\nThe monsoon further advances to the north and by 15 July the entire country comes under the spell of monsoon.\nThen comes the season of retreating monsoon or autumn.\nBy the early October the monsoon starts withdrawing or retreating from North India.\nThe retreating monsoon season is spread over October and November.\nAs you can see from the map the retreating monsoon brings heavy rainfall to Tamil Nadu and parts of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala.\nThis was the explanation of the four main seasons of India.\nHowever the term climate means the average weather condition of a place measured over many years.\nIndia is said to have a tropical monsoon type of climate.\nThe term monsoon is derived from the Arabic word mohsim meaning season.\nIndia is located in the tropical region as you can see in the map at the back.\nTherefore most of the rain that India receives is brought by monsoon winds.\nIndia is an agricultural land as we all know and Indian agriculture depends upon the monsoon.\nGood monsoon means adequate rain and a good crop.\n\n\nThere are various factors that affect the climate of a place such as the location of the place, altitude, distance from the sea and relief.\nAs India is a vast land that stretches from the Himalayas to the Indian Ocean.\nTherefore India has a wide range of climatic conditions that differ region to region.\nFor example, Jaisalmeer and Bhikaneer in the desert of Rajasthan are very hot.\nDras and Kargil and Ladakh are extremely cold and Mumbai and Kolkata or any coastal area have moderate climate.\nMosinuram in Meghalaya is the world's highest rain for receiving place while it is quite possible that in a particular year Jaisalmeer and Rajasthan may receive no rain at all.\nNow from the climate let us move our attention towards the natural vegetation of India.\nYou might have seen and maybe sometimes grown also of variety of plant life such as grass, shrubs, bushes, trees etc.\nChildren when the plant life grows on its own in an area without any human interference or efforts it is called natural vegetation.\nNatural vegetation is also called Flora of a region.\nNatural vegetation varies with relief and climate.\nIt means the natural vegetation found on mountains is different from that on the plains and the plants found in the desert, vary from those found in wet and humid places.\nSince India has a variety of climatic conditions, a large range of natural vegetation is found here which can be divided into five types.\nTropical rain forests, tropical decidious forests, thorny bushes, mountain vegetation and mangrove forests.\nTropical rain forests are found in the regions which are warm and receive heavy rainfall.\nThese forests with several meter tall trees are so dense that very little sunlight reaches the ground.\nThese forests have different species of trees that shed their leaves at different periods of the year.\nTherefore these forests always appear to be green.\nThis is the reason that they are also called evergreen forests.\nThe major species found in these forests are Ebony, Mahogany, Rosewood, Sincona and Jamun.\n\n\nIn India, the rainforests are found in the western slopes of western guards, Assam, Meekhalia, West Bengal, Odisha and the Andmanen Nikobar islands.\nChildren tropical decidious forests which are also called monsoon forests are found in a large part of India.\nThe trees in these forests are usually not as close together as in the tropical rain forests.\nThey have a definite leaf shedding period also.\nFrom six to eight weeks in a year, major trees of decidious forests are Teek, Sal, Shisham, Sandalwood, People and Nim.\nThese forests are found in Madhya Pradesh, Chattisgarh, Jharkhand, Bihar, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra.\nThe third type of vegetation found in India is the Thornibushes that occur in dry regions of the country.\nThey are also referred to as desert vegetation.\nThey have needle-like leaves and some plants have leaves in the form of spines and that is to prevent loss of water.\nMajor species of trees found in these forests are cactuses, care, keaker, babul, bear, date palm and huck.\nThey are found in the states of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Punjab, Hariana, parts of Madhya Pradesh, eastern slopes of western guards and central rocky regions of the Decken plateau.\nThe fourth type of vegetation is the mountain forests.\nThey consist of different types of vegetation depending on the altitude.\nAs the altitude increases, temperature goes down.\nIn the high reaches between 1500 meters and 2500 meters, we find Konifaras forests, the trees are called Konikalenship.\nImportant trees found in these forests include Cheer, Pine, Silver Fird, Devdar and Spruces.\nNow the fifth type of vegetation that is Mangroof forests.\nThey can survive in saline or salty water.\nThey are found mainly in the Sundarbans in West Bengal, Pichavaram in Tamil Nadu, near Chilka in Odisha and in the Andmanan Nikubar islands.\nThe Sundari tree is a common species of Mangroof forests and Sundarbans are named after this Sundari tree only.\n\n\nChildren now let's find out the significance of forests.\nForests perform various functions.\nThey inhale carbon dioxide that we exhale and in return release or exhale oxygen, the life giving gas.\nThen their roots hold the soil firmly together and prevent soil erosion.\nThey produce products like timber for furniture, fuelwood, fodder, lag, gum, honey, fruits, medicinal plants and herbs etc.\nForest provide natural habitats for wildlife.\nThey enable percolation of water into the ground.\nBut children, a large part of natural vegetation has been destroyed due to the deforestation.\nThere is an urgent need to check deforestation so more and more trees should be planted and the existing ones should be protected.\nIt's high time for the people to be aware of the importance of trees.\nPrograms like Van Mahotsav can be very helpful in this direction.\nAs mentioned earlier that forests are natural home for a variety of wildlife.\nChildren wildlife refers to all those animals that have not been teamed or domesticated by humans.\nWildlife is also called fauna.\nOur country has a rich and varied wildlife that includes a large variety of mammals, reptiles, amphibians, birds, worms and insects.\nTiger or national animal is found in different parts of our country.\nMainly in the wildlife reserves set up by the government.\nAsiatic lions are found in the forests of Gujarat, the only remaining habitat of this majestic animal.\nThe elephant is found in the forests of Gujarat, Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal.\nOne-horned rhinoceros are found in the Kajiranga National Park of Asam.\n\n\nCamels are found mainly in the Great Indian Desert and wildasses dwell in the Marshi run of Kaj of Gujarat.\nWild goats, yaks, snow leopards, bear, chiru etc are found in the Himalayan region.\nOther than these many other animals are there such as monkey, wolf, jackal, leopard, wild boar, cheetahl, blackbuck, spotted deer, neel guy etc.\nIndia is also rich in bird life.\nPeacock, India's national bird is our pride.\nThe other birds found in India include parrots, pigeons, menna, geese, ducks, hornbills, bull bulls, cranes, herons etc.\nThe government has set up many bird sanctuaries to provide the birds their natural habitat and to give protection from hunters.\nAmong them, Bharatpur bird sanctuary which is now known as Keralid Ladiop, National Park is considered the largest in Asia.\nChildren, several varieties of snakes are also found in India.\nFor example, cobra, crates, wipers etc.\nDeforestation on a large scale has affected our wildlife directly.\nHunting is responsible for many species of wildlife to be on the verge of extinction and a large number of animals are already extinct.\nTo protect our wildlife, the government has created a number of national parks, wildlife sanctuaries and biosphere reserves.\nThe government has also initiated many animal specific projects to prevent them from becoming extinct, such as project tiger launched in 1973 and project elephant launched in 1992.\nNow, how can the common mass contribute in conserving wildlife children? You must be knowing that several parts of the bodies of animals are used to make different things.\nSo, we can do our bit to conserve wildlife by refusing to purchase such things.\nMoreover, the first week of October is observed as wildlife week every year in order to develop awareness about protecting the natural habitats of the animal kingdom.\nThat's all for the chapter.\nNow, there are some questions for you to revise the topic.\nFirst question, explain different types of seasons found in India.\n\n\nSecond question, mention different types of vegetation found in India.\nThird question, how are forest important for us? Fourth question, what should we do to conserve wildlife? Children, if you found this video helpful and wish to watch more of such content, do consider subscribing to the channel.\nAnd also, if you have any queries or questions, please write in the comment section below.\nThank you.india experiences four major seasons in a year that follow each other in a cycle. the first is the cold weather season or the winter season. the second is the south western monsoon season or the rainy season or the advancing monsoon season. the third is the autumn season or the season of retreating monsoon or the autumn season from October and November. the fourth season is the season of retreating monsoon or the autumn season.",

    "audio_transcript": "RBI   Reserve Bank of India\n\n Hey guys, welcome to my channel Dave Take Finance and in this video we would be looking after the Reserve Bank of India.\nSo without wasting any time let's get started with this video.\nAdding with the basic introduction, you know RBI is our central bank.\nRBI is central bank of India.\nWhen we talk about the establishment here it was established on 1st April 1935.\nThe current governor of RBI is Mr.\nShaktikant Das.\nThe headquarters of RBI is there in Mumbai, Maharashtra.\nAnd the major functioning of RBI is supervision of commercial banks and issuance of currency.\nSo this is also mentioned there in the Premibul of RBI which describe its main function as to regulate the issue of bank notes and keeping of reserves with a view to securing monetary stability in India and generally to operate the currency and credit system of the country to its advantage.\nSo this is how RBI describes its main functioning that is to issue the bank notes and to keep the reserves in order to keep a stability, maintenance in the country's economy, in the country's monetary policies and to operate the flow of currencies and credit to the public in an efficient way to its full advantage.\nLet's have a look at the functioning of RBI in a little bit more detail.\nIt controls and supervises the functioning of financial institutions, commercial banks, NBFCs by establishing certain set rules and regulations to be followed.\nSo you know RBI serves as a banker to all other banks.\nOkay, so whether we talk about any financial institution, whether we talk about any other scheduled or non-shaduled bank, any NBFCs all has to follow certain guidelines, certain set rules and norms which is pre-decided by the RBI and it is mandated, it is obligatory to be followed by these rules and norms are made, these rules and norms are made to safeguard the interest of the public who are depositing their money, who are taking credits from the bank to have a look over all these functioning of banks to have a look over to have a control over all these functioning RBI comes into picture.\nIt is authorized to facilitate the issuance and flow of currency in the country by analyzing economic structure and prevailing scenario to decide on the number of paper notes to be printed and circulated in the system.\nSo RBI is solely responsible for the issuing of currency notes.\nSo when we talk about the flow of currency in the system, in the flow of currency in the country, it is the RBI who is authorized to print the paper notes and it is RBI who is authorized to circulate these currency notes in the system.\nWhile RBI prints the paper currency coins are minted by the government of India and RBI acts as an agent for handling and just voting the coins.\nRBI also keeps on upgrading the security features and currency to avoid any kind of counterfeiting of currency.\n\n\nSo many a times we see in news or any other guidelines like to identify your currency originality.\nYou have to look after these all the features and these features are decided, these features are provided by RBI in the currency notes to avoid the counterfeiting to avoid any kind of malpractices involved.\nContinuing with the previous slide, it serves as a banker to the government by carrying out country's financial transactions efficiently by maintaining accounts of payments and receipts.\nSo RBI also serves as a banker to the government because government itself is having a lot of transactions on daily basis, whether we talk about the receipts, the payments being made, the foreign transactions, the domestic transactions and all those transactions could be served by maintaining accounts within the RBI.\nIt works as a banker's bank in a way that commercial banks hold their account, not be I deposit money and borrows money as and when required on the prevailing interest rates.\nSo as I told RBI also works as a banker's bank, while we have to take money, we have to deposit our money, we go to any of the bank.\nSimilarly, when the bank's are in need of money, when the bank's are in need of depositing money, they go to RBI and they are also in a similar way charged some kind of interest rate which is predetermined.\nIt's regulated for an exchange transaction by facilitating foreign trade and maintaining foreign exchange market in India to create Forex Reserve.\nSo not just domestic scenario, RBI is also responsible for maintaining the foreign exchange reserve to facilitate various foreign trade which is done with and which is done from our country to other countries to other foreign nations.\nAnd to keep to facilitate all these trading purposes, RBI is responsible for holding the reserves.\nReserves holding could help in making the imports to the country and various other foreign trades.\nUntil 2016, monetary policy was solely under control of RBI, but as in 2016, monetary policy committee had been farmed to decide and fixed the interest rate in India.\nSo when we talk till 2016, the monetary policy, monetary policy is like controlling the interest rate to control the economic scenario.\nSo this was solely under the control of RBI, but what happened in 2016, a separate monetary policy committee had been formed, which is authorized to decide to determine and fixed the interest rate.\nThe members of RBI are also involved in that, but this is how a separate committee has been formed.\nNow let us have a look at the various policy rates.\nWe would be covering the repurate and the reverse repurate, which is two of the main policy rates and the bank rate also, which is the main rates when we talk in concern of RBI and the commercial banks.\nSo let us have a look at the repurate.\nIt is a rate fast by RBI while lending money to commercial banks for a short time period of less than 90 days.\nOkay, so this rate is charged by RBI while lending money to commercial banks.\n\n\nAs I said, when we are in need of money, we go to banks and we borrow money similarly when the commercial banks are in need of money, they go to RBI and RBI provides the money required by them, but they also charge a certain fixed rate of interest.\nAnd when this interest rate, when this borrowing is for a shorter time period of less than 90 days, this is how repurate comes into picture.\nSo repurate is the interest rate charged by RBI while lending to commercial banks for a shorter term borrowing.\nIf RBI wants to make borrowing money expensive for commercial banks, it simply increases the repurate because increasing the repurate would make borrowing by commercial banks a little more difficult.\nAnd in similar way, it also decreases the repurate when it wants to make the borrowings by commercial banks cheaper.\nWhen we talk about the current repurate, so the current repurate in our country is 6.50%.\nNow the increase and decrease in repurate, why is that done? So just have a look over here.\nIncreased repurate makes borrowing costly for commercial banks as a result of which these commercial banks also increases the interest rate making borrowing spy public costlier.\nThis leads to less demand for loans reducing the money supply and economy to curve in question.\nOkay, so as I talked about the monetary policy in monetary policy, controlling over the interest rate is done to have a control over the economic scenario.\nSo when we talk about the inflation in the country, one way to control the inflation is also by increasing the repurate.\nHow does that happen? Because when repurate is increased, the commercial banks, the borrowings by commercial banks becomes costlier.\nAnd as a result, what does commercial banks do? They also increase the interest rate on the borrowings by the public.\nAnd when the borrowings on the interest rate increases for the public also, public tends to less demand for the loans go less for the loans.\nAnd thus what happens the money supply in the economy reduces and the demand is control.\nAnd when the demand is controlled, the supply is limited, the inflation is automatically controlled.\nSo this is how monetary policies are used in order to curve various economic situations.\nLet's have a look at the reverse repurate.\nIt is the interest rate fast by commercial banks on RBI for borrowing money.\nThis borrowing is usually for a shorter period of time.\n\n\nCurrent reverse repurate is 6.25%.\nOkay, so as we talked about repurate, it was commercial banks borrowing money from RBI.\nNow, in similar, in the opposite manner, when we talk, when RBI has to borrow money from the commercial bank, we call this as reverse repurate.\nSo it happens like sometimes RBI is need or is in the need of the money or it sometimes does it intentionally to reduce the liquidity in commercial banks any of the reason when RBI borrows money from commercial banks for a shorter period of time.\nThis is usually known as reverse repurate.\nThe interest rate charged is known as reverse repurate.\nAnd the current reverse repurate is 6.25% in our country.\nIt is sometimes done intentionally by RBI to reduce the liquidity in commercial bank.\nAs I already told, it is sometimes done intentionally by RBI to reduce the liquidity in commercial banks.\nBecause you know, when RBI borrows money from commercial banks in a way, some of the amount from commercial bank is deposited and is goes to the account of RBI.\nAnd that's the liquidity in the commercial banks reduces.\nSo it is sometimes done intentionally when RBI fees that the flow of money in the commercial banks is getting higher and that is not the required level.\nTalking about the bank rate, it is the interest rate charged by RBI on a long thumb borrowing spike commercial banks.\nIt is still now when we were talking about reverse repurates, reverse repurates, that was for a shorter term period.\nBut when we talk about the bank rate, it is for a longer term period.\nSo when commercial banks borrows money from RBI for a longer period of time, that is for more than 90 days, usually in short period of time, we were considering 90 days.\nAt that time period, it would be called as the bank rate.\nAnd the current bank rate is 6.75%.\nLet's have a look at the reserve ratios.\nFirst one is cash reserve ratio.\n\n\nIt is mandated to keep certain percentage of deposit as a cash reserve in RBI.\nThis obligatory deposit by commercial banks in RBI is known as cash reserve ratio.\nThe current CRR is 4%.\nOkay.\nSo whatever deposits are there with the commercial banks, they used to keep a proportion of percentage of their deposit as reserves with the RBI in form of cash.\nAnd this is what we call as the cash reserve ratio.\nIt is obligatory.\nThis is done in order to safeguard various interest involving the public and the bank.\nSo all the banks has to follow this rule and they have to keep a deposit with the RBI.\nThat is what we call cash reserve ratio.\nAnd the current CRR is 4%.\nSo if the banks are having a deposit of Rs 100, they would have to provide the Rs 4 as CRR.\nTalking about this touch-free liquidity ratio, it is proportion of net demand and time-lifed it is maintained.\nMandated to be maintained as liquid reserve, usually in the form of cash and gold reserve by commercial banks in RBI current as a lattice 19.5%.\nOkay.\nSo it is somewhat similar to CRR.\nThe only difference is that CRR was maintaining reserves in the form of cash.\nWhile here the commercial banks has to maintain reserves with RBI in form of cash as well as gold.\nAnd how this proportion is decided? This is on the basis of net demand and time liabilities.\nSo net demand here is referring to the current accounts by public, the saving accounts and the time liabilities are representing the fixed accounts, the fixed deposits, the FTs hold by the public.\n\n\nSo the proportion of this is considered and does it is decided how what percent is what promotion would be kept as liquid reserve with RBI in form of this cash and gold.\nSo the current SLR as you can see is 19.5%.\nSo this is the proportion of amount which the banks are required to maintain as reserve with RBI.\nSo this was all about this video.\nWe talked about RBI.\nWe see various functionings of RBI and then we moved to the policy rates where we covered the repurate, the reverse repurate and the bank rate.\nAnd finally we had a look at the reserve ratios which is the cash reserve ratio and statutory liquidity ratio.\nI hope you understand this video a little bit more about RBI.\nHow does it functions and in brief I tried to explain all those things.\nI hope you liked this video.\nThank you for watching.\nDo like and share my videos and don't forget to subscribe to my channel.\nThey take finance.\nThank you all.the Reserve Bank of India is the central bank of the country. it regulates the issue of bank notes and to keep the reserves. RBI is authorized to facilitate the issuing and circulation of currency in the country. it is also authorized to issue paper notes to be circulated in the system.

    "audio_transcript": "Indian National Movement\n\n Hello everyone, I am Kiranjushi.\nWelcome you all in Class 5 EVS Chapter Indian National Movement.\nDear children, you have learnt in the previous lesson that the British rule caused discontent among Indians and in 1857 a massive revolt broke out against the British rule.\nAfter the initial success of the revolt, it was suppressed by the British.\nAfter the revolt, the rule of the East India Company came to an end and the administration of India was taken over by the British government from the company.\nThe governor general was henceforth known as the Vice Roy as a direct representative of the British Crown.\nChildren during this time, there were many social and religious ill practices prevailing in the society.\nFor example, one such bad practice was sati, the burning alive of women on the funeral pyre of their husbands.\nAnother ill practice was female infanticide.\nChildren in many parts of India, the birth of a girl child was considered as a curse and therefore often the female infants were deliberately killed.\nThen there was another ill practice of child marriage.\nChildren especially the girls were married off at a very young age when they were neither physically nor emotionally ready for the marriage.\nCast system was also a great curse that divided and affected the quality of Indian society.\nSo children, there were some people who tried very hard to bring awareness amongst the people and thus reformed the society.\nThey led many social reform movements for this purpose.\nThey were known as social reformers.\nRajaramo Hanroya, Dayanand Saraswati, Ishwachandar Vidya Sagar, Sarasya Dhammakar.\nThey were some very renowned social reformers.\nYou can see the images in front of you.\nSo through the social reform movements of these social reformers, they worked to educate people and remove the evil social practices.\n\n\nThese social reformers strongly opposed the practice of sati, child marriage, female infanticide and caste system.\nThey worked tirelessly to promote education among people and especially among girls.\nThese social reformers also supported the idea of widow remarriage.\nThe efforts of social reformers bore fruit and slowly but gradually Indian society started changing.\nChildren, this was also the time when the feeling of nationalism was gradually spreading across the country.\nOn 20th December 1885, Alan Octavian Hume, you can see the image of this person in front of you.\nSo Alan Octavian Hume, a retired British civil officer, founded the Indian National Congress.\nThe first session of Indian National Congress was conducted in Bombay at the Gokuldas Tehpal Sanskrit Partshala from 28th December to 31st December 1885.\nW.C.\nBonerjee, full name was Vomesh Chandar Bonerjee was the president of this first session of Indian National Congress in which only 72 delegates participated.\nIn the beginning, the Congress had quite moderate aims.\nFor example, it wanted the British rule to be sensitive towards the problems and difficulties of the Indian people and to listen to the demands of the people of India.\nThe Indian National Congress wished the British rule to involve Indians while taking administrative decisions related to India.\nThe early leaders of the Indian National Congress were called the moderates who wanted gradual reforms and aimed at better association with the British rule.\nThe prominent moderate leaders were Surin Dranath Benerjee, Gopal Krishna Gokle, Firusha Mehta, Badrudinthayebji and Dadabai Narejee.\nChildren, Dadabai Narejee is also called the grand old man of India.\nYou know why? Because of his very long association with the Indian Freedom Struggle.\nChildren, these moderate Congress leaders had full faith that British would understand and remove their complaints, but British ignored their demands and complaints.\nThen some leaders realized that there was no point of appealing or requesting British government.\nThey had no faith in the British sense of justice and fair play.\n\n\nThey believed that their demands could only be heard by adopting forceful stronger measures.\nThese leaders were known as extremists or radicals.\nLalala Lajpatri in Punjab, Bal Gangadhar Thilak in Maharashtra, Bipin Chandrapal in Bengal were the prominent extremist leaders.\nThey were called Lal Bal Pal.\nThey demanded for Poon Swaraj or complete independence.\nBal Gangadhar Thilak made a forceful claim and gave the famous slogan, Freedom is my birth right and I shall have it.\nAt that time Bengal was the biggest state of British rule as well as the area of Congress dominance.\nSo, to weaken the stronghold of Congress and to divide the Hindus and the Muslims, the British decided to divide Bengal.\nSo, in 1905, Lord Kersen, you can see the image in front of you.\nLord Kersen, the then governor general of India declared the partition of Bengal.\nBut opposite to what the British had imagined, the partition further gave boost to the freedom struggle.\nThe leaders of Congress decided to boycott British goods and to use only Indian goods.\nIt was known as the Swadeshi movement or Swadeshi Andhulan.\nPeople gathered at crossroads, made huge burn fires and burnt the imported foreign clothes and goods that they had.\nPeople from every section of the society, even the students participated in this movement.\nNow to control this movement, the British put many people including students in jail.\nBut this did not stop the Indians from participating in the movement.\nAnd ultimately, the British had to cancel the partition of Bengal.\nNow to win back, the goodwill of the Indians, the British introduced some reforms.\nBy now the First World War broke out in 1914, the Indian soldiers helped the British during the war hoping that the British government would give more freedom and concession to Indians.\n\n\nBut the British began to repress the Indians even more than earlier.\nThey passed the Rollit Act on 6th February 1919.\nThis act empowered the British government to put anyone into jail without a trial.\nChildren, I am sure you all have heard about Mahatma Gandhi.\nThe year 1919 was also the year when Mahatma Gandhi started to participate actively in the freedom struggle.\nHis full name was Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi.\nHe was born in Pohrbhandar Gujarat.\nHe studied law in England and then went to South Africa as a barrister for almost 20 years.\nIn South Africa, he saw the racial discrimination done towards the black and coloured people.\nHe was moved by this ill treatment and struggled against this injustice.\nIn 1915, he returned to India and started contributing to the nationalist movement.\nHe had firm belief in truth and non-violence and he gave a new direction to the freedom struggle.\nBecause of his great contribution to the Indian freedom struggle, he was fondly called Bapu or Mahatma.\nThat's all for this chapter.\nIf you liked the video and found it helpful, please like, share and subscribe to the channel.\nThank you.children during this time, there were many social and religious ill practices prevailing in the society. social reformers worked tirelessly to promote education amongst people and especially among girls. the efforts of social reformers bore fruit and slowly but gradually Indian society started changing. children, this was also the time when the feeling of nationalism was gradually spreading across the country. if you want to know more about the Indian national movement, please visit www.indianationalmovement.org.",

    "audio_transcript": "The Great Indian Desert\n\n Hello everyone, I am Kiranjushi, hope you all are fine.\nWelcome you all in Class 5 EVS chapter The Great Indian Desert.\nThrough this chapter we will try to understand the location of the Great Indian Desert, we will learn about its physical features, its climate and the importance of the Great Indian Desert.\nFirst of all let us understand what is a desert.\nSo children, a desert is an area of land that is very dry because it gets very low amount of rainfall or no rainfall at all.\nAnd therefore it has almost no water, trees or plants.\nIn this chapter we are learning about the Great Indian Desert which is also known as the Third Desert.\nThat means Great Indian Desert and Third Desert are the name of same place.\nLet us understand the extent of the Great Indian Desert or the Third Desert.\nSo children, it stretches from the Gujarat plains in the south up to the borders of Punjab and Haryana in the north.\nAs you can see in the given image also, it means the Gujarat plains make the southern border of the Third Desert and in the north the southern boundaries of Punjab and Haryana border it.\nThe Aravali range which is the oldest mountain range in India marks the eastern borders of the Third Desert.\nThis was about the location of the Great Indian Desert.\nNow let us understand its features.\nThe Great Indian Desert or the Third Desert is very large dry region of sand and rocks.\nThis large region has small, small hills of sand which are known as sand dunes.\nSo a sand dune is a small mound or hill of sand which is formed by the wind.\nAs I said children that this region is very dry, it is because it receives very little or you can say low rainfall.\nThe luni river is the only river in the desert.\nIt is a seasonal river and does not have much water throughout the year.\n\n\nA very obvious question that comes in our mind is how did people travel through this vast desert.\nSo children in the olden days people used camel to travel across the desert.\nIn fact you might be knowing that camel is called the ship of the desert.\nYou know why? It is because of its physical advantages which help a camel to move in the desert easily.\nFor example, it has long padded feet that help it to take long strides on hot sand and walk easily.\nA camel stores food in its hump and can travel without water for many days.\nDue to these reasons, camel is truly the ship of the desert.\nNowadays geeps are also used in cities as means of transport.\nNow as we know that there is very little or no rainfall in the third desert, this great scarcity or shortage of water.\nAnd due to this water shortage, very few plants grow here.\nThese plants do not need much water to survive in the desert such as cactus, kikar, babool etc.\nThe desert plants have some special features.\nFor example, they are generally thorny and have long and deep roots.\nThe thorns help preventing loss of water and the deep roots help plants take water from surface ground level.\nThough the region is usually dry with no or very little vegetation, in some places children in the desert there are OSS2.\nChildren and OSS is a place in the desert where water comes up to the surface from deep underground.\nThe presence of water makes the surrounding area green and fertile.\nSo such a green and fertile place in the desert is called an OSS.\nAs these OSS provide suitable conditions for human settlements, many villages are developed around them.\nAs the desert area has great shortage of water, the government has tried to solve this problem and provide water to the people of desert by building a canal.\n\n\nChildren's canal is a human made water way or you can say an artificial water way that is used for irrigation, travel etc.\nand the water for a canal usually comes from a connecting river, lake or ocean.\nSo here a canal is built called Indragandhi canal which is named after the first woman prime minister of India Mrs Indragandhi.\nThis canal gets water from the river Sathla Jandviyas.\nThis is the longest canal of India.\nThe Indira Gandhi canal has provided water for irrigation facilities for drinking and industrial use.\nThis irrigation has resulted in the increase in agricultural production as well as the cultivated area.\nThus this canal has transformed a vast area of barren desert into fertile and good fields and many crops such as joir, bajra, maize, barley and even wheat are produced here.\nA large number of people in the desert are nomads.\nChildren nomads are people who move from place to place.\nThe banjaras are the nomadic people in the third desert.\nTheir main occupation is cattle rearing so they keep on moving from place to one place to another for the availability of water and pasture for grazing their animals.\nThese nomads are considered to be expert in making goods of iron.\nSome nomads are salt traders, fortune tellers, jugglers, acrobats, snake charmers, grindstone makers and basket makers also.\nChildren, the handicraft work and the tie and die of Rajasthan is very popular not only in India but also abroad and is a great source of earning as well.\nThis is one of the many important aspects of the third desert.\nLet us understand some more points of importance of the great Indian desert.\nSo the first point is the beauty of this region.\nThe tourists from within the country as well as from abroad come and visit this place attracted by its beauty.\nThe desert is also very famous for its lively festivals such as Tej, Ganga, Pushkar Fair etc.\n\n\nPeople visit here to witness and enjoy these festivals.\nThis region is also known for its vibrant colourful traditional clothing and attractive native jewelries.\nJaipur, Jaisalmeer, Jyotpur, Bikaner and Udaypur are some important cities of the third desert.\nThese places have many historical and tourist sites.\nTherefore many tourists from India and abroad visit here.\nNot only this, the region has also many wildlife sanctuaries such as Ranthambore, Sariska, Bharatpur which provide shelter to many animals as well as birds such as tigers, panthers, deer etc.\nThese wildlife sanctuaries are also a great attraction for people to visit here.\nChildren, the region is also quite popular for the beautiful historic Grand Palaces and Fords which were built by the Rajput kings.\nThus Rajasthan becomes one of the most popular tourist destination of India where both domestic and international tourists arrive.\nNow let's understand the climate of this region.\nSo dear children, the climate of the Great Indian Desert is extremely hot in the summer and extremely cold during the winter.\nIt is because of the presence of sand.\nThe sand has the feature that it absorbs heat very fast.\nSo the days are very hot and in the same way it cools down very fast to making the nights very cold.\nAnd the amount of rainfall in this desert is generally quite low.\nSo this was about the third desert or the Great Indian Desert.\nHope you liked the video and found it useful.\nDon't forget to subscribe the channel.\nThank you.the Great Indian Desert is an area of land that is very dry because it receives very little rainfall. children in the olden days people used camel to travel across the desert. the luni river is the only river in the desert and does not have much water throughout the year. it is a seasonal river and does not have much water throughout the year. a camel stores food and water in the desert and is used to transport

    "audio_transcript": "Judiciary\n\n Hello everyone, I am Kiran Joshi, hope you all are safe and sound.\nChildren, this is the first video of Class 8 Civics Chapter 5 Judiciary.\nAs we have learnt previously that in India we have the rule of law, means laws apply equally to parents and if a law is violated, a certain set of fixed procedures need to be followed.\nAnd for the enforcement of law, we have a judicial system.\nThis judicial system consists of courts and when a law is violated, citizens can approach to these courts.\nJudiciary is an independent organ of the Indian state.\nWhat is an independent judiciary and what is its role in democracy? Let's find out the answers of these questions through this video.\nThere are numbers of issues or matters on which courts take decisions.\nThe work of the judiciary or the judicial system can be divided into one dispute resolution, second judicial review and third upholding the law and enforcing fundamental rights.\nLet's take the first point, that is dispute resolution.\nOur judicial system offers a mechanism or process to resolve disputes which may occur between citizens, between citizens and government and the government, between two state governments and between the center and state governments.\nNow the second task of our judiciary, that is judicial review.\nJudiciary is the final interpreter of the constitution.\nTherefore, it has the power to cancel a law passed by the parliament.\nDeclearing it as illegal and unenforceable if it believes that the law is not in accordance with the intention of the constitution or it violates the basic structure of the constitution.\nIt is called judicial review.\nThe third task of the judiciary is to uphold the law and enforce fundamental rights.\nChildren, every citizen of India can move to the court if they believe that their fundamental rights have been violated.\nIf you remember you learnt in class 7, the story of Hakim Sheikh, who was severely injured after falling from a running train and who was denied to be admitted in several government hospitals.\nThe Supreme Court ruled in his case that fundamental right to life also include right to health and directed the West Bengal government to pay Hakim Sheikh compensation for the laws he suffered.\n\n\nThis was the clear example of upholding the law and enforcing fundamental rights by the judiciary.\nNow let us understand the meaning of an independent judiciary.\nSuppose there is a judicial system in which a politician has the power that he can appoint as well as dismiss a judge from his office.\nThat means the judge's office.\nNow in such a system, if a powerful politician encroaches on your land and you take this case of encroachment to court, definitely the judge would be partial to the politician because he has the control over the judge.\nTherefore, the judge cannot take independent decision because the judge is not independent and is under the control of the politician.\nIt would force the judge to make all judgments in favor of the politician but the Indian constitution protects against this kind of situation by providing for the independence of the judiciary.\nOne aspect of the independence of Indian judiciary is the separation of powers which is a key feature of the constitution.\nIt means that the other two branches of the state, the legislature and the executive cannot interpret, interfere in the work of judiciary.\nJudiciary is not under the government and does not act on their behalf.\nNow this separation of powers is effective only when the appointment of the judges in the high court and the supreme court is done without or with very little interference of the legislature and executive.\nAfter their appointment, these judges of high courts and supreme court cannot easily be removed from the office.\nAs the judiciary is independent and not under the influence of legislature and executive, the courts can play an important and mean role to ensure that these two branches of the government do not misuse their powers.\nThe judiciary also plays an important role in protecting the fundamental rights of citizens as mentioned earlier that they can approach the court if they believe that their rights have been violated.\nNow let us understand the structure of Indian judiciary.\nThe judiciary is organized hierarchy, which has three different levels of court as shown here in front of you at the top supreme court, then high court and at the lower level subordinate or district court.\nIn the lower level, there are several courts, these courts are called the subordinate or district courts.\nChildren, the states are divided into districts and each district has a district court.\nThe district court and the courts below it are called subordinate courts.\nThese courts are of two types, civil courts which deal with civil cases and courts.\n\n\nCriminal courts which deal with criminal cases.\nThese courts are presided over by a district judge.\nChildren, most people interact with these courts with their different kinds of cases.\nMost of the states have a high court, each with which is the highest court of the state.\nThe high court deals with all cases that are under the jurisdiction of the state.\nAt the top of the hierarchical structure of judiciary is the supreme court, which is the highest court in India.\nIt is located in New Delhi and is presided over by the chief justice of India.\nThat means chief justice of India is the head of the supreme court.\nThe decisions given by the supreme court are binding on all other courts in India.\nThat means the judgment given has to be accepted by the other courts in of India.\nChildren the Indian judiciary is single, integrated and unified.\nThat means the different levels of courts are connected to each other and the decisions made by higher courts are binding on the lower courts.\nThis integration can also be understood by the appellate system.\nAppellate system means if a person believes that the judgment given by the lower court is not just or a person is not satisfied with the judgment given by a lower court, he or she can appeal to a higher court.\nLet us understand this appellate system through a case.\nThis case is state Delhi administration versus Lakshman Kumar and others 1985, which was tried from lower courts to the supreme court.\nIn February 1980, Lakshman Kumar married Sudha Gowel and they lived in a flat in Delhi with Lakshman's brothers and their families.\nOn 2nd December 1980, Sudha died in hospital due to burns.\nSudha's family filed a case in the trial court.\nChildren trial court is another name for subordinate court.\n\n\nFor the hearing of the case, four of her neighbors were called as witnesses.\nThey told the court that on the night of 1st December when they heard Sudha scream, they forced their way into Lakshman's flat and found Sudha standing with her sari in flames.\nThe neighbors stated that they wrapped Sudha in a gunny bag and a blanket to extinguish the fire.\nSudha told the neighbors that her mother-in-law Shakuntila had poured kerosene oil on her and that her husband Lakshman had lit the fire.children's video of class 8 civics chapter 5 shows the judiciary in action. the judicial system is an independent organ of the state of india. children's video follows the story of a man who was severely injured after falling from a train. children's video also shows the judiciary's role in upholding the law and enforcing fundamental rights. judiciary is the final interpreter of the constitution and has the power to cancel laws.",

    "audio_transcript": "The Coastal Plains and Islands\n\n Hello everyone, I am Kiranjoshi, hope you all are fit and fine.\nIn our journey of physical divisions of India, let's learn about the coastal plains and islands of India through this video.\nLook at the map in front of you.\nYou will notice two strips of plains along the east and west coast of India.\nThese are the coastal plains of India.\nChildren, a coast is the area or the land where it meets the sea or the ocean.\nYou can also say that a coast is a line that makes the boundary between the land and the sea or the ocean.\nSo children, our country has a long and beautiful coastline which extends for about 7000 kilometers from run of catch in the west to west Bengal in the east.\nIt means it stretches all around the Indian Peninsula.\nThe coastal plains are broadly divided into the western coastal plains and the eastern coastal plains.\nSo let's begin with the western coastal plains.\nThe western coastal plains are located between the western cards and the Arabian sea.\nThe western coastal plain is long and narrow as shown in the image also.\nThe western coastal plains have many small gulfs and bays.\nChildren gulfs and bays are the different types of water bodies.\nThese gulfs and bays on the western coast provide many natural harbours.\nA harbour is an area of the sea along the coast which is deep enough and partly enclosed by the land so that the ships or the boats can be left there safely.\nSome famous natural harbours in the western coastal plains are Mumbai in Maharashtra, Vasco in Goa and Cochin Kerala.\nAlso, there are several ports on the western coastal plains.\nA port is a town or a city that develops around a harbour where ships load and unload their cargo and passengers.\n\n\nThe western coastal plains can be divided into three parts.\nGujarat coast, Kunkan coast and the Malabar coast.\nThe nethermost part of the western coastal plains is the Gujarat coast.\nIf you look closely to the given image you will see children that it is broadest between the gulf of cutch and the gulf of kumbhurt.\nAs I said earlier, that a gulf is a type of water body.\nTo make the term more clear to you, I can say that a gulf is a large area of sea or ocean water which is partly surrounded by land.\nTo the south of the Gujarat coast lies the Kunkan coast.\nKunkan coast is stretched up to Goa.\nKunkan coast is quite narrow, rocky and uneven.\nTherefore, we find many lighthouses across the coast to warn the ships so that they may remain away from the rocks that light just beneath the surface of the sea.\nYou will be curious to know the meaning of the term lighthouse.\nSo children, look at the image in front of you.\nIt is the image of a lighthouse.\nA lighthouse is a tower or a tall building with a powerful light on or near the sea to guide ships away from the danger.\nThe Kunkan coast is rich in oil resources and many oil wells such as Bombay High are found here.\nTo the further south lies the Malabar coast.\nThe coastline here has uneven edges.\nMalabar coast is known for its numerous lagoons or backwaters.\nChildren a lagoon is a lake of saltwater which gets separated from the sea by barrier islands or reefs.\nNow let's learn about the eastern coastal plains.\n\n\nDear children, the eastern coastal plains are located between the Bay of Bengal and the eastern cards.\nThey extend from Ganga delta in the west Bengal to Kanyakumarine Tamil Nadu.\nThe eastern coastal plains are comparatively broader than the western coastal plains.\nThere are a number of southern rivers such as Mahanadi, Guudawri, Krishna and Kavadi that flow eastwards and fall into the Bay of Bengal.\nThese rivers form the delta along the eastern coastal line.\nThe land here is very fertile because of the mineral rich soil brought by these rivers and a lot of rice is grown in this area.\nSo this plain is also known as the rice bowl of India.\nThe eastern coastal plains of India have many ports among which Chennai and Vesaka Patnam are of great importance.\nWhen the eastern coastal plains can be further divided into two parts, the northern part of the eastern coastal plain is called the Nathansar Cards and the southern part is called the Coromantal Coast.\nThe eastern coastal plain and the western coastal plain meet at Kanyakumarine Tamil Nadu.\nChildren Kanyakumarine is the southernmost point of the mainland of India.\nAnother important fact about Kanyakumarine is that at this place, the three water bodies around India, the Indian Ocean, the Rebhen Sea and the Bay of Bengal meet.\nSo children, so far in this video we have learnt about the coastal plains of India.\nNow let's try to understand or learn about the island groups of India.\nFirst of all let's understand the meaning of island, so an island is a small piece of land that is surrounded by water from all around such as Lake River or Sea.\nIndia has two island groups on both sides of the Indian Peninsula.\nThese are the Andman and Nicobar islands located in the Bay of Bengal and the Lakshudip islands situated in the Arabian Sea.\nAndman and Nicobar islands lie in Bay of Bengal.\nThey are roughly 572 islands out of which only 38 islands are inhabited.\nA large part of the population consists of tribal groups.\n\n\nPort Player is the capital of Andman and Nicobar islands.\nChildren the famous cellular jail is also in Andman and Nicobar islands.\nAndman and Nicobar islands are mostly hilly islands and are covered with forests.\nThe Lakshudip islands lie in the Arabian Sea consisting of 36 islands.\nHowever, only 11 islands are inhabited.\nCoverity is the capital of Lakshudip islands.\nThe Lakshudip islands are generally flat.\nThese islands are well known for their coral deposits.\nYou might be thinking or wondering what are corals, so children corals are tiny sea creatures with a hard body covering.\nNow let's learn about the importance of the Indian coastal plains and the island groups.\nSeveral big and small ports are there along the coastal areas.\nThese ports play an important role in the growth of a national and international trade.\nThen there are several harbours also.\nThen many coastal towns and cities are great attraction for tourists.\nChildren fishing is one of the important occupations for many people here.\nMany different types of crops are grown in this region.\nFor example, rice, coconut, rubber etc.\nThe island groups of India are very popular and attractive tourist spots.\nIf we talk about the climate, so this region has moderate climate.\nBecause this region is quite close to the sea, so during the day it is warm and humid.\n\n\nHowever, the nights are mostly cool.\nThe reason behind it is that at night the sea breeze blows towards the land from the sea.\nThat's all for this chapter.\nHope you found this video helpful and if you like this video, do remember to share and subscribe to the channel.\nThank you.children, our country has a long and beautiful coastline which extends for about 7000 kilometers from run of catch in the west to west Bengal in the east. the western coastal plains are located between the western cards and the Arabian sea. the western coastal plains have many small gulfs and bays on the western coast. the nethermost part of the western coastal plains is the Gujarat coast, Kunkan coast and the Malabar coast.",

    "audio_transcript": "Mineral and Power Resources\n\n Hello everyone, I am Kiranjushi, hope you all are safe and sound.\nHere I am presenting the first video of class 8 geography chapter 3, mineral and power resources.\nFirst of all, we should know what is a mineral.\nSo, its definition is a mineral is a naturally occurring substance that has a definite chemical composition.\nIt means minerals occur naturally and are not made by humans.\nThey are solid substances which are made of one or more elements combined together.\nMinerals are unevenly distributed on the earth, they are concentrated in a particular area or rock formation.\nThere are some minerals which are found in such places which are difficult to access.\nFor example, the arctic ocean bed and untactica.\nChildren in such inaccessible places, the extraction of minerals becomes very expensive or technically difficult.\nTherefore, becomes unprofitable.\nThrough the definition of minerals, we have already learnt that minerals are formed naturally without any human interference.\nThey are formed in various geological environments under different conditions.\nThose rocks which contain enough minerals so that mining dam is economically suitable or known as ores.\nMinerals are identified through their physical properties such as color, density, hardness and chemical properties such as solubility.\nChildren, there are nearly 3000 different minerals.\nThese minerals on the basis of composition are classified mainly as metallic and non-metallic minerals.\nMetallic minerals can further be classified as ferrous and non-ferrous minerals and non-metallic minerals may be organic and inorganic minerals.\nMetallic minerals contain metals in raw form.\nNow, what are metals? So children, metals are hard substances that conduct heat and electricity.\n\n\nMetals have a characteristic lustre or shine.\nIron or copper, magnesium are some examples of metallic minerals.\nChildren, as I said earlier, metallic minerals may be ferrous or non-ferrous.\nNon-ferrous metallic minerals that contain iron are called ferrous minerals.\nFor example, iron ore, magnesium, chromite, etc.\nNon-ferrous minerals are those metallic minerals which do not contain iron, but they may contain some other metals.\nFor example, gold, silver, copper, these are the examples of non-ferrous minerals.\nThis was about the metallic minerals.\nAs the name itself explains, do not contain metals.\nSome examples of non-metallic minerals are limestone, mica, gypsum and mineral fuels like coal, petroleum, etc.\nNow the non-metallic minerals are either organic or inorganic by origin.\nNon-metallic minerals that contain carbon are organic minerals.\nFor example, coal, natural gas, petroleum while inorganic minerals do not contain carbon such as mica, limestone, graphite.\nNow the question is how are the minerals extracted? Children, extraction of minerals can be done by mining, drilling or querying.\nMining can be open-cast mining or shaft mining.\nFirst, let us understand what is mining.\nSo, mining is the process of taking out minerals from rocks buried under the earth surface.\nMining can be open-cast mining and shaft mining as I said earlier.\nWhen the minerals that lie at shallow depths are extracted by removing the surface layer, it is called open-cast mining.\nAnd to reach mineral deposits that lie deep below the earth surface, deep bores called shafts are to be made.\n\n\nThis is known as shaft mining.\nAs petroleum and natural gas occur far below the surface of the earth, so to take them out, deep wells are bored.\nIt is called drilling.\nDrilling is also done offshore.\nWhen the minerals that lie near the surface are simply dug out, the process is called querying.\nNow let us see the distribution of minerals over the earth.\nMinerals occur in different types of rocks, such as igneous rocks, metamorphic rocks and sedimentary rocks.\nMostly metallic minerals are found in igneous or metamorphic rocks which make large platutes.\nIron ore in the Thutanakpur plateau in India, iron ore in North Sweden, copper and nickel deposits in Ontario, Canada and iron ore nickel, platinum and chromaids in South Africa.\nThese are some examples of minerals found both in igneous and metamorphic rocks.\nNow sedimentary rocks which are formed along the plains and youngfold mountains have deposits of non-metallic minerals which may be organic or inorganic in origin.\nLime stone deposits in the Caucasus mountain in France, Magnees deposits in Ukraine and Georgia and the phosphate belts of Algeria are some examples of minerals.\nNon-metallic minerals.\nMineral fuels like coal and petroleum are also found in between layers of sedimentary rocks.\nNow let us see the distribution of minerals in different continents.\nLet us begin with Asia.\nIn Asia rich iron ore deposits are found in China and India.\nChina produces more than 50% of the world's tin.\nChina, Malaysia and Indonesia are included among the world's leading producers of tin.\nChina leads in production of lead antimony and tungsten.\n\n\nSaudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, they have world's largest reserves of petroleum and natural gas.\nThe continent that means the Asia continent also has large deposits of Magnees, Bokside, Nickel, Zinc and Copper.\nNow if we talk about Europe, so Europe is one of the leading producers of iron ore in the world.\nRussia, Ukraine, Sweden and France, these are the European countries which have large deposits of iron ore.\nIn Eastern Europe and Eastern Russia, Copper, Lead, Zinc, Magnees and Nickel are found.\nThe Rural value of Germany is rich in coal deposits.\nNow let us find which minerals are found in North America.\nIn North America there are three major zones where mineral deposits are found.\nThey are the Canadian region, North of the Great Lakes, the Appalachian region and the mountain ranges of the West.\nIn the Canadian shield region, iron ore, nickel, gold, uranium and copper are mined.\nRich coal deposits are found in the Appalachian region.\nWestern codilers have vast deposits of copper, lead, zinc, gold and silver.\nNow in South America, in South America Brazil is the largest producer of high grade iron ore in the world.\nChile and Peru are leading producers of copper.\nBrazil and Bolivia are among the world's largest producers of tin.\nLarge deposits of gold, silver, zinc, chromium, magnees, boxite, mica, platinum asbestos and diamond are also found in South America.\nMexico, Venezuela, Argentina, Chile, Peru and Colombia, these countries are rich in mineral oil.\nNext continent is Africa, this continent is rich in mineral resources.\nAfrica is the world's largest producer of the precious minerals like diamond, gold, silver and platinum.\nA fairly large part of the world's gold is produced by South Africa, Z and Zimbabwe.\n\n\nSome of the other minerals found in Africa are copper, iron ore, chromium, uranium, cobalt and boxite.\nOil is also found in Nigeria, Libya and Angola.\nThen comes Australia continent which is one of the largest exporters of minerals.\nFor example, it is the world leader in the production of boxite, iron ore, coal, gold, diamond, tin and nickel.\nAustralia is also quite rich in magnees, copper, lead and zinc.\nFor Carl Gourli and Coolgardia areas of Western Australia have the largest deposits of gold.\nIf we talk about Antarctica, so children, geologists and geographers have identified the existence of a variety of minerals deposits among which some may be quite large.\nIt is forecasted that large deposits of coal in the trans-antastic mountains and deposits of iron ore near the Prince Charles mountains of east Antarctica may be found.\nEven gold, silver and oil are present there in commercial amount.\nHowever, children mining for commercial reasons is banned here.\nMany researchers continue to do some mining here in order to find answers to their scientific queries.\nSo, this was about the continent-wise distribution of minerals.\nNow, let us see the distribution of different minerals in India.\nLet us begin with iron ore.\nIn India, deposits of high-grade iron ore are found.\nThe mineral is found mainly in Jharkhand, Odisha, Chattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh.\nThere are also considerable deposits of iron ore in Goa, Maharashtra and Karnataka in South.\nNow, the another mineral box site.\nSo, box site is the ore of the metal aluminum.\nIn India, Odisha is the largest producer of box site.\n\n\nOther box site producing areas are Jharkhand, Chattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.\nIndia is the largest producer and exporter of mica in the world.\nIts deposits mainly occur in Jharkhand, Vihar and Pradesh and Rajasthan.\nAnother major mineral found in India is copper.\nIt will mainly produce in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.\nMagnes.\nSo, Magnes which is of Ferris mineral is mainly found in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chattisgarh, Odisha, Karnataka and Telangana.\nOther limestone producing states in India include Vihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Chattisgarh, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu.\nNow the another mineral is gold.\nIn India, Kolar in Karnataka have the largest deposits of gold.\nThese gold mines are very deep.\nIn fact, they are among the deepest in the world due to which mining of this ore, that means gold is a very expensive process.\nThen comes the mineral salt which is obtained from seas, lakes and rocks.\nIndia is one of the leading producers and exporters of salt.\nGujarat, Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan are the leading states in salt production.\nIf we talk about the uses of minerals, then children, there would hardly be any industry where minerals are not used.\nMinerals are used for gems.\nSuch minerals are usually hard.\nThey are then set in different styles for jewelry.\nCopper is an indispensable metal in the electrical industry because it is widely used for making wires, electric motors, transformers and generators.\n\n\nWhatever it was used for making coins also, so we can say that copper is used in everything from coins to pipes.\nSilicon is another very important mineral which is used in computer industry and is obtained from quartz, then aluminum which is obtained from the from box site.\nIt is used to manufacture automobile automobiles and aircrafts.\nIt is also used by industries which deal with the construction, furniture, fittings and kitchenware etc.\nChildren, minerals have endless uses but we must remember that minerals are non-renewable.\nOnce exhausted, they take a very long time, say thousands of years to develop and therefore they cannot be replenished immediately at the time of need because the rate of their formation is much slower than the rate at which we consume these minerals.\nTherefore, they have to be conserved and not be misused at all.\nIt is necessary to reduce their wastage in the process of mining.\nThe way is the mineral in which the mineral resources can be conserved is the recycling of metals.\nThat is all for this video.\nThe rest part of the chapter will be covered in the next video.\nTill then, try to solve the following questions.\nFirst question, describe briefly methods of extraction of minerals.\nMineral occur in different types of rocks, explain.\nThird question, describe the mineral distribution in Africa and Australia.\nFourth question, write the common uses of minerals.\nWhy are minerals considered non-renewable? If you found this video helpful and wish to watch more of such content, do consider subscribing to the channel.\nAlso, if you have any queries or comments, please post them in the comment section below.\nThank you.a mineral is a naturally occurring substance that has a definite chemical composition. it means minerals occur naturally and are not made by humans. children in such inaccessible places, the extraction of minerals becomes very expensive or difficult. metallic minerals can be classified as ferrous and non-ferrous minerals and non-metallic minerals. a mineral is a solid substance that is made of one or more elements combined together. it is a mineral that is formed naturally without any human interference.",
