      "audio_transcript": "induction_motor\n\n Hello and welcome to the presentation presented by Group 13.\nThis presentation is based on the topic of induction motor.\nFurther in the presentation, we have discussed the working principles and application of induction motor.\nTo discuss about the classification of motors, I would like to invite Abhishek.\nThank you very much.\nMy name is Abhishek Gupta, role number 2130175.\nClassification of motor.\nElectric motor is classified into two types based on the type of current used for its functioning AC motor or DC motor.\nAC motor is further classified into two types.\nSynchronous AC motor or induction AC motor.\nWe will discussing more about induction AC motor in coming slides.\nIntroduction of induction AC motor.\nAn induction AC motor in which electric current in the rotor need to produce torque is obtained by electromagnetic induction from the magnetic field of a stator winding.\nInduction motor are available for both three phase and single phase operation.\nThree phase induction motors are used for high power and industrial application.\nSingle phase induction motor find using domestic electrical appliances.\nInduction motor are most common motor in the industry.\nAn induction motor work on transforming action.\nIt consists of two parts.\nStator and rotor.\n\n\nStator is a stationary part of the motor.\nThe stator core is hollow cylindrical structure.\nIt is made up of seat steel lamination.\nEach about 0.4 mm thick slotted on its inner surface.\nSmall size motor, the slots are partially closed type.\nThis helps in reducing the effective length of the air gap between the stator and the rotor.\nFor large size motor, the slots are open type, rotor.\nThe motor in an electrical core may be either a square case or a wire one.\nNow I would like to pass my further discussion to my fellow Sumit.\nThank you Abhishek.\nNow as Smith, Roll number 2, 1, 3, 0, 1, 8, 0 will take you further to the presentation.\nSquirrel case rotor.\nIt consists of laminated cylindrical core having semi-clue circular slots at the outer periphery.\nCopper or aluminum bark conductors are placed in the slots and short circuited at each end by copper or aluminum.\nThe rotor winding is permanently short circuited and it is not possible to add any external resistance.\nNow as we can see from the diagram, the different parts of squirrel case rotor such as the long cylindrical bar is called the SAFT.\nIt consists of cylindrical or steel lamination with aluminum or copper conductor embedded in its surface.\nAnd the other parts are aluminum or copper bars, laminated iron bars, aluminum or copper end cap at the surface.\nNow I would like to pass over the presentation to Kanishk.\nThanks Smith.\n\n\nI am Kumar Kanishk, Roll number 176.\nI am here to explain the Wound rotor rotor of an induction motor.\nAs you can see in the diagram, Wound rotor consists of winding, sleeping, shafts, slots and skewed slots.\nA Wound rotor induction motor is defined as a special type of three-phase AC induction motor designed to provide high starting torque by connecting an external resistance to the rotor circuit.\nMoving on to the next slide, it is also called a sleeping rotor.\nConsist of a laminated core having semi-clue slots at the outer periphery and carries a three-phase insulated winding.\nThe rotor is wound for the same number of poles of the rotor stator.\nThe three finished terminals are connected together, forming a star point and the three star terminals are connected to three sleep rings, feeds on the shaft.\nNow I would like to request herzra guys to continue the presentation.\nThank you Kanishk.\nI am herz, Roll number 2130177.\nAnd I will be discussing about the working principle of induction motor.\nAs we know, an induction motor consists of a stator and a rotor.\nThe stator and rotors have windings on them.\nWhen we supply a three-phase AC current to the motor stator, it creates a magnetic field that rotates in sync with the AC oscillations.\nThe rotating magnetic flux that cuts the rotor winding induces voltage in the rotor winding.\nDue to the fact that the rotor windings are short circuited for both squirrel cage as well as via bound rotor and induced current flows in the rotor winding.\nThe rotor current, the rotor current thus induces another magnetic field.\nAnd when this magnetic field interacts with the stator's magnetic field, a net torque is produced which further results in the generation of shaft power, which hence which concludes the working of an induction motor.\nNext to discuss more about a very important component of induction motor slip, I would like to call upon Rm.\n\n\nThank you Arrm, Roll number 2130179 is going to show something about slip.\nThe rotor speed must always remain less than synchronous speed and S.\nSo, what is synchronous speed? Synchron speed is the speed of rotation of the magnetic field in a rotate wave machine.\nThe difference between the synchronous speed and the actual speed N of the rotor is known as slip speed.\nAs you can see in the equation N delta is equal to Ns minus N.\nSo, here S is equal to slip and slip is equal to Ns minus N which is further divided by Ns.\nWhen the motor is in standstill, the rotor speed N is 0 and Ns is equal to 1.\nThe value of S can never be 0 because synchronous speed can never be achieved.\nNow, I am going to tell about frequency of rotor currents.\nWhen the induction motor is at standstill, the frequency of the current induced in the rotor winding is the same as the supply frequency.\nHowever, when the motor runs the frequency of the rotor current depends upon the related speed or slip speed.\nAs you can see in the equation FR is equal to S into F.\nNow, I would like to call upon her for speed of rotation.\nThank you, RN.\nMy name is Sommaraj and my raw number is 230178.\nNow, I would like to explain about the topic speed of rotation of rotor field.\nThe rotor currents produce their own rotating magnetic field.\nSince the frequency FR of the rotor rotor currents is SF, the speed of this rotating field is SNS, with respect to the rotor winding.\nHowever, the rotor itself is running at a speed N with respect to the stator.\nSpeed of the rotor field in space is equal to speed of the rotor field related to the rotor, plus speed of the speed of relative to the stator.\n\n\nThus, we find that even though the rotor is not rotating at synchronous speed, the rotor field studates at the synchronous speed.\nIn fact, the rotor field remains locked with the stator field in respect to the rotor speed.\nNow, applications.\nSingle-phase induction motor finds used in domestic electrical appliances such as fans, refrigerators, washing machines, pumps, hairdress, etc.\nThree-phase induction motors are used for high pressure, high power and in domestic applications such as lifts, cranes, pumps, exhaust vents, lath, etc.\nThank you for being patient.induction motor is a type of motor that produces torque by electromagnetic induction. it is available for both three phase and single phase operation. induction motor are most common motor in the industry. a motor in an electrical core may be either a square case or a wire one. a motor in an electrical core may be either a square case or a wire one, if it is a square case or a wire one.",

It is a non-conducting substance which do not allow electricity to pass through them, but can pass only electric field through them.\nDialectric Constant, it is found experimentally that the capacitance of a capacitor is increased if the space between its place is filled with the electric materials.\nTypes of Dialectrics, there are two types of Dialectrics, non-polar Dialectrics and Polar Dialectrics.\nNon-polar Dialectrics are molecules in which the center of gravity of the positive and the negative charges electrons coincide.\nSo, such molecules does not have any permanent dipole.\nFor example, some molecules are oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen.\nAs mentioned, Dialectrics having non-polar molecules are known as non-polar Dialectrics.\nComing to Polar Dialectrics, non-polar molecules having the center of gravity of the positive charge is separated by finite distance from that of negative charges.\nUnbalanced electric charges usually balance electrons of such molecules present in dipole movement and orientation.\nTherefore, these molecules possess permanent electric dipole.\nFor example, HCl and 2O, H2O, etcetera.\nThe Dialectrics having Polar molecules are known as Polar Dialectrics.\nTypes of Polarization.\nElectronic Polarization and ionic polarization and orientation polarization are three types.\nElectronic Polarization is under the action of external field when an electron cloud of the atoms are displaced with respect to heavy fixed and nuclear to a distance less than the dimensions of the atom.\nThis is called electronic polarization and it is represented in the equation of P E bar is equal to N alpha E E bar.\nAs shown in the figure, you can understand.\n\n\nIonic polarization, this kind of polarization occurs in ionic crystals.\nFor example, like sodium chloride, N A C L, in presence of external field, the positive and negative ions are displaced in opposite direction and will ionic bond forces stops the process.\nThis way of dipoles get induced ionic polarization does not depend on temperature but whereas, electronic polarization also does not depend on temperature.\nOrientation polarization, this type of polarization is applicable in Polar Dialectrics.\nIn the absence of an electric field, the permanent dipoles are oriented, oriented randomly such that they cancel the effect of each other when the electric field is applied.\nSo, dipoles tend to rotate and align in the direction of the applied field.\nThis is known as all interpolation, orientation polarization which depends upon temperature whereas, in ionic and electronic polarization, it does not depend on temperature.\nIn view of all the polarization, some of the electronic and ionic polarization, total gives the total polarization and is given by P bar is equal to P E plus P E I plus P E mo.\nLaw and internal electric field.\nLet a diatriate be placed between the plates of parallel plate capacity and let their P and imaginary spherical cavity around the atom A as shown in the figure inside the diallectric.\nIt is also assumed that the radius of the cavity is large compared to that of radius of the atom.\nThe internal field of an atom side A can be considered to be made up of the following four components namely E 1, E 2, E 3 and E 4.\nField E 1 is a field intensity at A due to the charge density of the plates where E 1 is equal to d by E epsilon naught.\nSo, that d is equal to P plus epsilon naught E 1 is equal to unsubstuting d in place of E 1.\nWe get P plus epsilon naught E by epsilon naught which gives E plus P by epsilon naught.\nField E 2 is E 2 is the field intensity at A due to the charge density induced on the two sides of the diallectric where E 2 is equal to minus P by epsilon naught.\nE 3 is the field intensity at A due to other atoms contained in the cavity.\nWe are assuming a cube structure.\nSo, E 3 is equal to 0 because of the symmetry of the cube as shown in the figure.\nField E 4 is of field intensity due to the polarization charges on the surface of the cavity as and was calculated by law runs which is equal to P by 3 epsilon naught.\n\n\nThe total internal field may be expressed as E i which is equal to E 1 plus E 2 plus E 3 plus E 4.\nOn some we get E plus P by 3 epsilon naught.\nComing to Clausius-Massotti equation, let us consider the elemental dielectric material in which there are no ions and permanent dipoles.\nThen polarizability and orane, orientational polarizability alpha naught and R 0 alpha i is equal to alpha naught is equal to 0.\nSo, we get polarization P is equal to N into mu where P is equal to N into alpha E into E i where mu is equal to alpha E i where E i is equal to as we derived in the previous law runs internal electric field.\nWe get E i is equal to E plus P by 3 epsilon naught here are the derivations.\nFinally, we get N alpha E by 3 epsilon naught is equal to E i minus epsilon naught plus E epsilon naught plus 2.\nHere comes the conclusion.\nThank you.dielectrics are a non-conducting substance which do not allow electricity to pass through them, but can pass only electric field through them. there are two types of Dialectrics, non-polar Dialectrics and Polar Dialectrics. electronic polarization, ionic polarization and orientation polarization are three types of polarization. ionic polarization occurs in ionic crystals, like sodium chloride, N A C L.",

So children, metals are hard substances that conduct heat and electricity.\n\n\nMetals have a characteristic lustre or shine.\nIron or copper, magnesium are some examples of metallic minerals.\nChildren, as I said earlier, metallic minerals may be ferrous or non-ferrous.\nNon-ferrous metallic minerals that contain iron are called ferrous minerals.\nFor example, iron ore, magnesium, chromite, etc.\nNon-ferrous minerals are those metallic minerals which do not contain iron, but they may contain some other metals.\nFor example, gold, silver, copper, these are the examples of non-ferrous minerals.\nThis was about the metallic minerals.\nAs the name itself explains, do not contain metals.\nSome examples of non-metallic minerals are limestone, mica, gypsum and mineral fuels like coal, petroleum, etc.\nNow the non-metallic minerals are either organic or inorganic by origin.\nNon-metallic minerals that contain carbon are organic minerals.\nFor example, coal, natural gas, petroleum while inorganic minerals do not contain carbon such as mica, limestone, graphite.\nNow the question is how are the minerals extracted? Children, extraction of minerals can be done by mining, drilling or querying.\nMining can be open-cast mining or shaft mining.\nFirst, let us understand what is mining.\nSo, mining is the process of taking out minerals from rocks buried under the earth surface.\nMining can be open-cast mining and shaft mining as I said earlier.\nWhen the minerals that lie at shallow depths are extracted by removing the surface layer, it is called open-cast mining.\nAnd to reach mineral deposits that lie deep below the earth surface, deep bores called shafts are to be made.\n\n\nThis is known as shaft mining.\nAs petroleum and natural gas occur far below the surface of the earth, so to take them out, deep wells are bored.\nIt is called drilling.\nDrilling is also done offshore.\nWhen the minerals that lie near the surface are simply dug out, the process is called querying.\nNow let us see the distribution of minerals over the earth.\nMinerals occur in different types of rocks, such as igneous rocks, metamorphic rocks and sedimentary rocks.\nMostly metallic minerals are found in igneous or metamorphic rocks which make large platutes.\nIron ore in the Thutanakpur plateau in India, iron ore in North Sweden, copper and nickel deposits in Ontario, Canada and iron ore nickel, platinum and chromaids in South Africa.\nThese are some examples of minerals found both in igneous and metamorphic rocks.\nNow sedimentary rocks which are formed along the plains and youngfold mountains have deposits of non-metallic minerals which may be organic or inorganic in origin.\nLime stone deposits in the Caucasus mountain in France, Magnees deposits in Ukraine and Georgia and the phosphate belts of Algeria are some examples of minerals.\nNon-metallic minerals.\nMineral fuels like coal and petroleum are also found in between layers of sedimentary rocks.\nNow let us see the distribution of minerals in different continents.\nLet us begin with Asia.\nIn Asia rich iron ore deposits are found in China and India.\nChina produces more than 50% of the world's tin.\nChina, Malaysia and Indonesia are included among the world's leading producers of tin.\nChina leads in production of lead antimony and tungsten.\n\n\nSaudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, they have world's largest reserves of petroleum and natural gas.\nThe continent that means the Asia continent also has large deposits of Magnees, Bokside, Nickel, Zinc and Copper.\nNow if we talk about Europe, so Europe is one of the leading producers of iron ore in the world.\nRussia, Ukraine, Sweden and France, these are the European countries which have large deposits of iron ore.\nIn Eastern Europe and Eastern Russia, Copper, Lead, Zinc, Magnees and Nickel are found.\nThe Rural value of Germany is rich in coal deposits.\nNow let us find which minerals are found in North America.\nIn North America there are three major zones where mineral deposits are found.\nThey are the Canadian region, North of the Great Lakes, the Appalachian region and the mountain ranges of the West.\nIn the Canadian shield region, iron ore, nickel, gold, uranium and copper are mined.\nRich coal deposits are found in the Appalachian region.\nWestern codilers have vast deposits of copper, lead, zinc, gold and silver.\nNow in South America, in South America Brazil is the largest producer of high grade iron ore in the world.\nChile and Peru are leading producers of copper.\nBrazil and Bolivia are among the world's largest producers of tin.\nLarge deposits of gold, silver, zinc, chromium, magnees, boxite, mica, platinum asbestos and diamond are also found in South America.\nMexico, Venezuela, Argentina, Chile, Peru and Colombia, these countries are rich in mineral oil.\nNext continent is Africa, this continent is rich in mineral resources.\nAfrica is the world's largest producer of the precious minerals like diamond, gold, silver and platinum.\nA fairly large part of the world's gold is produced by South Africa, Z and Zimbabwe.\n\n\nSome of the other minerals found in Africa are copper, iron ore, chromium, uranium, cobalt and boxite.\nOil is also found in Nigeria, Libya and Angola.\nThen comes Australia continent which is one of the largest exporters of minerals.\nFor example, it is the world leader in the production of boxite, iron ore, coal, gold, diamond, tin and nickel.\nAustralia is also quite rich in magnees, copper, lead and zinc.\nFor Carl Gourli and Coolgardia areas of Western Australia have the largest deposits of gold.\nIf we talk about Antarctica, so children, geologists and geographers have identified the existence of a variety of minerals deposits among which some may be quite large.\nIt is forecasted that large deposits of coal in the trans-antastic mountains and deposits of iron ore near the Prince Charles mountains of east Antarctica may be found.\nEven gold, silver and oil are present there in commercial amount.\nHowever, children mining for commercial reasons is banned here.\nMany researchers continue to do some mining here in order to find answers to their scientific queries.\nSo, this was about the continent-wise distribution of minerals.\nNow, let us see the distribution of different minerals in India.\nLet us begin with iron ore.\nIn India, deposits of high-grade iron ore are found.\nThe mineral is found mainly in Jharkhand, Odisha, Chattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh.\nThere are also considerable deposits of iron ore in Goa, Maharashtra and Karnataka in South.\nNow, the another mineral box site.\nSo, box site is the ore of the metal aluminum.\nIn India, Odisha is the largest producer of box site.\n\n\nOther box site producing areas are Jharkhand, Chattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.\nIndia is the largest producer and exporter of mica in the world.\nIts deposits mainly occur in Jharkhand, Vihar and Pradesh and Rajasthan.\nAnother major mineral found in India is copper.\nIt will mainly produce in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.\nMagnes.\nSo, Magnes which is of Ferris mineral is mainly found in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chattisgarh, Odisha, Karnataka and Telangana.\nOther limestone producing states in India include Vihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Chattisgarh, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu.\nNow the another mineral is gold.\nIn India, Kolar in Karnataka have the largest deposits of gold.\nThese gold mines are very deep.\nIn fact, they are among the deepest in the world due to which mining of this ore, that means gold is a very expensive process.\nThen comes the mineral salt which is obtained from seas, lakes and rocks.\nIndia is one of the leading producers and exporters of salt.\nGujarat, Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan are the leading states in salt production.\nIf we talk about the uses of minerals, then children, there would hardly be any industry where minerals are not used.\nMinerals are used for gems.\nSuch minerals are usually hard.\nThey are then set in different styles for jewelry.\nCopper is an indispensable metal in the electrical industry because it is widely used for making wires, electric motors, transformers and generators.\n\n\nWhatever it was used for making coins also, so we can say that copper is used in everything from coins to pipes.\nSilicon is another very important mineral which is used in computer industry and is obtained from quartz, then aluminum which is obtained from the from box site.\nIt is used to manufacture automobile automobiles and aircrafts.\nIt is also used by industries which deal with the construction, furniture, fittings and kitchenware etc.\nChildren, minerals have endless uses but we must remember that minerals are non-renewable.\nOnce exhausted, they take a very long time, say thousands of years to develop and therefore they cannot be replenished immediately at the time of need because the rate of their formation is much slower than the rate at which we consume these minerals.\nTherefore, they have to be conserved and not be misused at all.\nIt is necessary to reduce their wastage in the process of mining.\nThe way is the mineral in which the mineral resources can be conserved is the recycling of metals.\nThat is all for this video.\nThe rest part of the chapter will be covered in the next video.\nTill then, try to solve the following questions.\nLet us start with simple observations of the minerals that can be read by the figures to be seen.\nAfrica and Australia.\nFourth question.\nWrite the common uses of minerals.\nWhy are minerals considered non-renewable? Children, if you found this video helpful and wish to watch more of such content, do consider subscribing to the channel.\nAlso, if you have any queries or comments, please post them in the comment section below.\nThank you.a mineral is a naturally occurring substance that has a definite chemical composition. it means minerals occur naturally and are not made by humans. children in such inaccessible places, the extraction of minerals becomes very expensive or difficult. metallic minerals can be classified as ferrous and non-ferrous minerals and non-metallic minerals. a mineral is a solid substance that is made of one or more elements combined together. it is a mineral that is formed naturally without any human interference.",
